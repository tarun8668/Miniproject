## Stock Analysis Web App
The integration of a stock analysis web application offers users a seamless platform for tracking and predicting stock trends. By utilizing the yFinance API and implementing linear regression models, this project aims to simplify financial analysis and assist users in making informed investment decisions.

## About
The Stock Analysis Web App leverages financial data from the yFinance API, allowing users to access real-time and historical stock market information. Traditional methods of financial analysis often require complex tools and financial expertise. This web app bridges the gap by providing an easy-to-use interface, enabling users to conduct stock analysis and view predictions directly on the platform.
The core of the system integrates linear regression models to forecast stock prices based on historical data, helping investors identify trends and make well-informed decisions.
